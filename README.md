# The_fall_of_VISIOM

This is my "first" text game and game i created.

It's really simple. It was my project to work on during holiday.

It's just for fun if you like adventure text games.

How to run it:
If you are reading this you are probably also in this folder.
Just find a main.exe file in this folder and click on it.
main.exe will start the game and you can play right away.

Hope you'll have great time playing my game ;)
